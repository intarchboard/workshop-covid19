# Introduction

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) held a workshop to discuss
Network Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, on November 9-13, 2020. The
workshop was held to convene interested researchers, network
operators, and network management experts, and Internet technologists
to share their experiences. The meeting was held online given the
on-going travel and contact restrictions at that time.

COVID-19 has caused changes in Internet traffic. These changes
appeared rather abruptly and were significant, in particular during the introduction of the
initial quarantine and work-from-home arrangements. The changes relate
to traffic volumes, location of traffic, as well as the types of
traffic and applications used.

Announcement for the workshop was sent out in July 2020, requesting
interested parties to submit position papers for the workshop program
committee. A total of 15 position papers were received from
altogether 33 authors. The papers are listed in {{positionpapers}}.
In addition, several other types of contributions and pointers to
existing work were provided. A number of position papers referred to
parallel work being published in measurement-related academic
conferences.

Invitations for the workshop were sent out based on the position
papers and other expressions of interest. On the workshop conference calls were 45
participants, listed in {{participants}}.

The workshop was held over one week hosting three sessions covering
i) measurements and observations, ii) operational issue, and iii) final future consideration
and conclusions. As these three sessions were scheduled Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
a positive side effect was that the time in between could be used for mailing
list discussion and compilation of additional workshop material.

# Scope {#scope}

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on people's lives
and the societies and economies around the globe. But it also had big
impact on networking. With large numbers of people working from home
or otherwise depending on the network for their daily lives, network
traffic volume has surged. Internet service providers and operators have
reported a 20% traffic growth or more in a matter of weeks. Traffic in
Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) is similarly on the rise. Most forms
of network traffic have seen an increase, with conversational
multimedia traffic growing in some cases more than 200%. And user time
spent on conferencing services has risen by an order of magnitude on
some conferencing platforms.

In general, the Internet has coped relatively well with this traffic
growth, albeit not without some issues. For instance, some outages,
video quality reduction, and other issues were reported. Nevertheless,
it is interesting to see how the technology, operators and service
providers have been able to respond to large and sudden changes in traffic
patterns.

Understanding what actually happened with Internet traffic is of
course interesting by its own right. How that impacted user
experience, or the intended function of the services is equally
interesting. Measurements and reports of the traffic situation from 2020
are therefore valuable. But it would also be interesting to understand
what types of network management and capacity expansion actions were
taken in general. Anecdotal evidence points to Internet and service
providers tracking how their services are used, and in many cases
adjusting services to accommodate the new traffic patterns, from
dynamic allocation of compute resources to more complex changes.

The impacts of this crisis are also a potential opportunity to
understand the impact of traffic shifts and growth more generally, or
to prepare for future situations — crisis or otherwise – that impact
networking. Or even allow us to adjust the technology to be even
better suited to respond to changes.

The scope of this workshop included:

* measurements about traffic changes, user experience, service performance, and other relevant aspects
* discussion about the behind the scenes network management and expansion activities
* experiences in the fields of general Internet connectivity, conferencing, media/entertainment, and Internet infrastructure
* lessons learned for preparedness and operations
* lessons learned for Internet technology and architecture

# Discussion Topics {#discussion-topics}

## Measurement-based Observation on Network Traffic Dynamics {#measurement}

The workshop started with a focus on measurements. A large portion of the submitted
papers presented and discussed measurement data and these submissions provided a good
basis get a better understanding of the situation, covering different angles and
aspects of network traffic and kind of networks.

At a high level, the traffic in mobile networks decreased as a result of reduced population mobility while traffic from home networks 
increased. As a result of the shift for working and learning at home, there was a strong increase in video conferencing and remote 
learning application traffic. The typical diurnal usage patterns in network traffic also changed, with peak times occuring earlier in the day 
and peak times lasting longer over the day - reflecting the start of the work or school day from home. 

### Overall traffic growth 

The global pandemic has significantly accelerated the growth of data traffic worldwide.
Based on the measurement data of one ISP, three IXPs, a metropolitan educational network,
and a mobile operator it was observed at the beginning of the workshop {{Feldmann2020}} that overall the
network was able to handle the situation well despite a significant and sudden increase in traffic
growth rate in March/April. That is, after the lockdown is implemented in March a traffic increase
of 15-20% at the ISP as well as the three IXPs was observed. That represents the traffic growth
expected in a typical year which now took place in the matter of a few weeks only---a substantial
increase. At DE-CIX Frankfurt, the world's largest Internet Exchange in terms of data throughput,
the year 2020 has seen the largest increase in peak traffic within a single year since the IXP was
founded in 1995. Additionally, mobile traffic is slightly receding. In access networks, the growth rate
of upstream traffic also exceeded the growth in downstream traffic, reflecting increased adoption
and use of video conferencing and other remote work and school applications.

Most traffic increases happen during non-traditional peak hours: Before the first COVID-19 lockdowns, the main time
of use was in the evening hours during the week, whereas since March it has been spread equally
across the day. That is, the increase in usage is mainly occurring outside the previous peak usage
times (e.g. during the day while working from home). This means that, for the first time, network
utilization on weekdays resembles that on weekends. The effects of the increased traffic volume can
easily be absorbed: either by using existing reserve capacity, or by quickly switching additional bandwidth.
This is one reason why the Internet was able to cope well with the pandemic during the first lockdown period.

Some of the lockdowns were lifted or relaxed around May 2020. As people were allowed to perform some
of their daily habits outside of their home again, we see a decrease of the traffic at the IXPs and the ISP;
instead mobile traffic is now growing again.


### Changes in application use

We see a strong increase in the traffic associated to web conferencing, video, and gaming traffic in March 2020
as a result of the increasing user deman for solutions like Zoom or Microsoft Teams.
Also, as people spend more hours at home, they tend to watch videos or play games, thus increasing entertainment traffic demands.
Interestingly, we also see a decrease in educational traffic in these vantage points.

The composition of data traffic has changed since the beginning of the pandemic: the use of
videoconferencing services and virtual private networks (VPNs) for access to company resources
from the home environment has risen sharply. In ISP and IXP network it was overserved {{Feldmann2020}}
that traffic associated to web conferencing, video, and gaming increased largely in March 2020.
For example, the relative traffic share of many "essential" applications like VPN and conferencing tools
increased by more than 200%. At the same time, the traffic share for other traffic classes decreases
substantially, e.g., traffic related to education, social media, and---for some periods---CDNs.
In April and June, web conferencing traffic is still high compared to the pre-pandemic scenario,
while a slight decrease in CDN and social media traffic is observed. During these months many people
are still working from home, but restrictions have been lifted or relaxed, which likely leads to an increase
in in-person social activities and a decrease in online ones.

#### Example campus networks

Changes in traffic have been observed at University campus networks as well, especially due to the necessary adoption of remote teaching. The Politecnico di Torino University (Italy) deployed its in-house solution for remote teaching, which caused the outgoing traffic to grow by 2.5 times, driven by more than 600 daily online classes. Incoming traffic, instead, decreased by a factor of 10 due to the cessation of any in-presence activity. Based on their measurements, this change in traffic and network usage did however not lead to noticeable performance impairments, nor significantly poor performance have been observed for students in remote regions of Italy. Further, outgoing traffic increased as well due to remote working solutions such as collaboration platforms, VPNs and remote desktop.

Similar changes were observed by measuring REDIMadrid {{Feldmann2020}}, a European educational and research network, which connects 16 independent universities and research centers in the metropolitan region of Madrid. A drop of up to 55% in traffic volume on working days during the pandemic was observed. Similar to findings for ISP/IXP networks, it was observed that working days and weekend days are becoming more similar in terms of total traffic. The hourly traffic patterns reveal a traffic increase between 9 pm and 7 am. This could be due to users working more frequently at unusual times, but also potentially caused by overseas students (mainly from Latin America and East Asia as suggested by the AS numbers from which these connections come from) who access university network resources from their home countries.

Given the fact that the users of the academic network (e.g., students and research staff) had to leave the campus as a response to lockdown measures, also the traffic in/out (i.e., ingress/egress) ratio changed drastically. Prior to the lockdown, the incoming traffic was much larger then the outgoing traffic. This changed to a more balanced setting. This change of traffic asymmetry can be explained by the nature of remote work.
On the one end, users connect to the network services mainly to access resources, hence the increase in outgoing traffic. On the other end, all external (i.e., Internet-based) resources requested during work are no longer accessed from the educational network but from the use

#### Example mobile networks

Mobile network data usage appeared to decline following the imposition of localized lockdown measures, as these reduced typical levels of mobility and roaming.

#### Summary

Changes in Internet traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic are affecting different networks in various ways. Yet all networks observe some form of change, be it in a reduction in traffic, an increase in traffic, a change in working days and weekend days patterns, or a change in traffic classes. Traffic volume, directionality ratios, and its source and destination are radically different from before COVID-19. This behavior is antagonistic, yet complementary, to the one observed in residential ISPs.

### A deeper look at interconnections

Traffic at points of network interconnection noticeably increased but most operators reacted quickly by rapidly adding additional capacity {{Feldmann2020}}. The amount of increases varied, with some networks that hosted popular applications such as video conferencing experiencing traffic growth of several hundred to several thousand percent. At the IXP-level, it was observe that port utilization increases. This phenomenon is mostly explained by a higher traffic demand from residential users.

Measurements of interconnection links at major US ISPs by CAIDA and MIT found some evidence of diurnal congestion around the March 2020 timeframe, but most of this congestion disappeared in a few weeks, which suggests that operators indeed did take steps to add capacity or otherwise mitigate the congestion.

### Cloud platforms

Cloud infrastructure played a key role in supporting bandwidth-intensive video conferencing and remote learning tools to practice social distancing in COVID-19 pandemic. Network congestion between cloud platforms and access networks could impact on the quality of experience of these cloud-based applications. CAIDA leveraged web-based speed test servers to perform download and upload throughput measurements from virtual machines in public cloud platforms to various access ISPs in the United States {{Mok2020}}.

The key findings included:

* Persistent congestion events were not widely observed between cloud platforms and these networks, particular for large-scale ISPs, but we could observe large diurnal download throughput variations in peak hours from some locations to the cloud.
* There is evidence of persistent congestion in the egress direction to regional ISPs serving suburban areas in the U.S. Their users could suffer from poor video streaming or file download performance from the cloud.
* The macroscopic analysis over 3 months (June-August, 2020) revealed downward trends in download throughput from ISPs and educational networks to certain cloud regions. We believed that increased use of the cloud in the pandemic could be one of the factors that contributed to the decreased performance.

### Last mile congestion

Last-mile is the centerpiece of broadband connectivity, where poor last-mile performance generally translates to poor quality of experience. In a recent IMC'20 research paper Fontugne et al. investigated last-mile latency using traceroute data from RIPE Atlas probes located in 646 ASes and looked for recurrent performance degradation {{Fontugne2020-1}}. They found that in normal times Atlas probes in only 10% ASes experience persistent last-mile congestion but they recorded 55% more congested ASes during the COVID-19 outbreak. This deterioration caused by stay-at-home measures is particularly marked in large eyeball networks and certain parts of the world. They found Japan to be the most impacted country in their study looking specifically at NTT OCN, but noting similar observations for several Japanese networks, including IIJ (AS2497).

From mid-2020 onwards, they however observe better performance than before the pandemic. In Japan, this is partly due to the deployments originally planned for accommodating the Tokyo Olympics, and more generally, it reflects the efforts of network operators to cope with these exceptional circumstances. The pandemic has demonstrated that its adaptive design and proficient community can keep the Internet operational during such unprecedented events. Also, from the numerous research and operational reports recently published, the pandemic is apparently shaping a more resilient Internet, as Nietzsche wrote, “What does not kill me makes me stronger”.

### User behaviour

The type of traffic needed by the users also changed in 2020. Upstream
traffic increased due the use of video conferences, remote schooling,
and similar applications. The NCTA and Comcast reported that while
downstream traffic grew 20%, upstream traffic grew as much as 30% to
37% {{NCTA2020}} {{Comcast2020}}. Vodafone reported that upstream
traffic grew 100% in some markets {{Vodafone2020}}.

Ericsson's Consumer Lab surveyed users for their usage and experiences
during the crisis). Some of the key findings in {{ConsumerlabReport2020}} were:

* 9 in 10 users increased Internet activities, and time spent
  connected increased. In addition, 1 in 5 started new online
  activities, many in the older generation felt that they were helped
  by video calling, parents felt that their children's education was
  helped, and so on.

* Network performance was in general found satisfactory. 6 in 10 were
  very satisfied with fixed broadband, and 3 in 4 felt that mobile
  broadband was the same or better compared to before the crisis.  Consumers valued
  resilience and quality of service as the most important task for
  network operators.

* Smartphone application usage changed, with fastest growth in
  COVID-19, remote working, e-learning, wellness, education, remote
  health consultation, and social shared experience
  applications. Biggest decreases were in travel
  and booking, ride hailing, location, and parking applications.

Some of the behaviours are likely permanent changes
{{ConsumerlabReport2020}}. The adoption of video calls and other new
services by many consumers, such as the older generation, is likely
going to have a long-lasting effect.  Surveys in various organizations
point to a likely long-term increase in the number of people
interested in remote work {{WorkplaceAnalytics2020}} {{McKinsey2020}}.

## Operational Practises and Changes {#operational}

The second day of the workshop focussed on operational issues. 

### Digital Divide

Measurements from Fastly confirmed that Internet traffic volume, in
multiple countries, rose rapidly at the same time as COVID cases increased
and lock down policies came into effect. Download speeds also decreased,
but in a much less dramatic fashion than overall bandwidth usage increased.
School closures led to a dramatic increase in traffic volume in many regions,
and other public policy announcements triggered large traffic shifts. This
suggests that governments might usefully coordinate with operators to allow
time for pre-emptive operational changes, in some cases.

Measurements from the US showed that download rates correlate with income
levels. However, download rates in the lowest income zip codes increased
as the pandemic progressed, closing the divide with higher income areas.
One possible reason for this in the data is decisions by some ISPs, such
as Comcast and Cox, that increased speeds for users on certain plans and in
certain areas. This suggests that network capacity was available, and that
the correlation between income and download rates was not necessarily due
to differences in the deployed infrastructure in different regions,
although it was noted that certainly access link technologies provide more
flexibility than others in this regard.


### Applications

The web conferencing systems (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Webex) saw
incredible growth, with overnight traffic increases of 15-20% in response
to public policy changes, such as lock downs. This required significant
and rapid changes in infrastructure provisioning.

Major video providers (YouTube, etc.) reduced bandwidth by 25% in some
regions. It was suggested that this had a huge impact on quality of
videoconferencing systems until networks could scale to handle full
bit-rate, but other operators of some other services saw limited impact.

Updates to popular games has a significant impact on network load. Some
discussions were reported between ISPs, CDNs, and the gaming industry on possibly
coordinating various high-bandwidth update events, similar to what was
done for entertainment/video download speeds. There was an apparently 
difficult interplay between
bulk download and interactive real-time applications, potentially due to
buffer-bloat and queuing delays. 


### Observability

It is clear that there is a contrast in experience. Many operators reported few
problems, in terms of metrics such as measured download bandwidth, while
video conferencing applications experienced significant usability problems
running on those networks (defined as more than 1s/min of major artefacts). 
The interaction between application providers and network providers worked
very smoothly to resolve these issues, supported by strong personal
contacts and relationships. But it seems clear that the metrics used by
many operators to understand their network performance don't fully capture
the impact on certain applications, and there is an observability gap.



## Architectural Considerations and Conclusions for the Future {#architecture}

The final session of the workshop considered the architectural
issues arising and other conclusions that could be reached.
In general many of these topics had been covered earlier so
the report-out from this session is more brief.

### DSCP point and counterpoint

Largely following on from earlier discussions related to
observability and relating to traffic priorities, 
we had a discussion starting from DSCP marking,
basically wondering if a minimal priority marking scheme
would have helped during the pandemic, e.g. by allowing
marking of less-than-best-effort traffic.

That discussion quickly deolved into the usual QoS and
observability discussion, as always also touching on
the effects of increased encryption. (The group once
more succeeded in not making headway in resolving the
different perspectives and interests involved in that,
but did demonstrate that we're making progress on
the discussion being less heated;-) 


### Security

The group discussed a submission {{Kirsty2020}} dealing with
changes in attack patterns subsequent to the move towards
working from home. At a high level there wasn't much of an
uptick in the number of attacks seen, but it was notable 
that different lures
were used in phishing attacks, demonstrating that bad
actors had also adjusted to the pandemic to an extent.
The group noted, that, in constrast to measuring traffic
changes, it was harder to measure how the pandemic affected 
security and
perhaps there is scope for research on that topic.

Overall, it may be that the pandemic caused fewer security
changes than one would have guessed had one been asked,
pre-pandemic, what would happen if many people started to
work from home a lot. However, that is not to say that
the security situation was good before the pandemic nor
that it is good during the pandemic - it seems rather
the opposite. 

## Conclusions {#conclusions}

There is a wealth of data about the performance of the Internet during
the crisis. The main conclusion from the various measurements is that
fairly large shifts occurred. And those shifts were not merely about
changing one application for another, they actually impacted traffic
flows and directions, and caused in many cases a significant traffic
increase. Early reports also seem to indicate that the shifts have
gone relatively smooth from the point of view overall consumer
experience.

An important but not so visible factor that led to this was that
many people and organizations where highly motivated to ensure good
experience. A lot of collaboration happened in the background,
problems were corrected, many providers significantly increased their
capacity, and so on.

In general, the Internet also seems well suited for
adapting to new situations, at least within some bounds.  The
Internet is designed for any application and situation, rather than
optimized for today's particular traffic. This makes it possible to
use it for many applications, in many deployment situations, and make
changes as needed. The generality is present in many parts of the
overall system, from basic Internet technology to browsers, from name
servers to content delivery networks and cloud platforms. When needs
change, what is needed is often merely different services, perhaps
some re-allocation of resources, but not fundamental technology or
hardware changes.

On the other hand, this is not to say that no improvements are needed:

* Better understanding of the health of the Internet: Going forward,
  the critical nature that Internet plays in our lives means that the
  health of the Internet needs to receive significant
  attention. Understanding how well networks work is not just a
  technical matter, it is also of crucial importance to the people and
  economy of the societies using it. Projects and research that
  monitor Internet and services performance in a broad scale and
  across different networks are therefore important.

* The pandemic has shown how the effects of the digital divide can be
  amplified during a crisis. More attention is needed to ensure that
  broadband is available to all, and that Internet services equally
  serve different groups.

* We need to continue work on all the other improvements that are seen
  as necessary anyway, such as further improvements in security, ability
  for networks and applications to collaborate better, etc.

* Informal collaboration between different parties needs to continue
  and be strengthened.

## Feedback on meeting format

While there are frequently virtual participants in IAB workshops, the
IAB had no experience running workshops entirely virtually.

Feedback on this event format was largely positive, however. It was
particularly useful that as the three sessions were scheduled Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, the time in between could be used for mailing
list discussion and compilation of additional workshop material.
The positive feedback was likely at least partly due to the fact
that many of the workshop participants knew one another from
previous face-to-face events (primaily IETF meetings).

The process for sending invitations to the workshop should be improved
for next time, however, as a few invitations were initially lost, and
in a virtual meeting it may be more reasonable to invite not just one
person but co-authors of a paper, for instance. At least for this
workshop, we did not appear to suffer from too many participants, and
in many cases there may be some days when a particular participant may
not be able to attend a session.
